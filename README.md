# Computer Science Review Tool
COMP 755 Final Project

Our project will be a Python-based interactive quiz aimed to help users solidify Computer Science topics. A server set to listening mode will accept client requests to connect to the preset IP address and port number. Once connected, clients will choose their username and either create or join a quiz room. Each quiz room will have a unique code that will allow other clients to connect to it. Clients can notify the host that they are ready to begin the quiz and, as they answer the multiple choice questions, their scores will be tallied and displayed. At the end of each quiz, total scores will be displayed and the clients will have the option to play again, join another room, or leave the server.
